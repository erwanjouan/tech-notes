> Reliability is the most fundamental feature of any product: a system isn’t very useful if nobody can use it

Ben Treynor Sloss, Google’s VP for 24/7 Operations

Because reliability is so critical, SREs are focused on finding ways to improve the design and operation of systems to make them more scalable, more reliable, and more efficient. However, we expend effort in this direction only up to a point: when systems are “reliable enough,” we instead invest our efforts in adding features or building new products.

the availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring,
emergency response, and capacity planning of their service(s).
